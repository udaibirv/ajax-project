# hoopLegend
hoopLegend enables a user to pick their favorite NBA team and access information based on their selection. The information was taken from a free to use API called 'balldontlie'.  

## Features 
1. User can create a profile and choose their favorite team
2. User can view recent results for their team
3. User can view results from other games around the NBA
4. User can view notable performances from players on their team
5. User can view the upcoming schedule for their team

## Things I Learned
* API data can sometimes be inconsistent so it is important to come up with workarounds when such problems arise 
* Proper planning before writing any code goes a long way in terms of effiecency and can reduce amount of errors encountered 
* How to recieve and manipulate data from an API
