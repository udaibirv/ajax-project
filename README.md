hoopLegend enables a user to pick their favorite NBA team and access information based on their selection. The information was taken from a free to use API called 'balldontlie'. Perhaps the most importnant lesson I learned throughout the duration of this project that free API's may be inconsistent with their data, and it is up to me to take those inconsistencies into consideration and attempt to create an easy to use interface for the user. 

## Features 
1. User can create a profile and choose their favorite team
